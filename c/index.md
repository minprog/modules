# Module 1: C

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You'll start with the small ones!

## What to Do

### 0. Getting Started

The goal of this exercise is to try out compiling your program, maybe fixing a typo and getting used to the editor. No need to submit!

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:.external}
- Write your first program: [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/hello/){:.external}

### 1. Preparation

You'll create an instance of the CS50 IDE, which will be your "code editor" for the weeks coming. The goal is to write a very small program from scratch and learning to test your program using `check50`. (Note that the IDE currently only works in Chrome and Firefox!)

- Login to the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/){:.external} using your GitHub account
- Learn about using the [Command Line](/shorts/command-line) in the IDE
- Create a "`module1`" directory in the IDE as by `mkdir ~/module1` and `cd` into it
- Implement [Water](/problems/water) and immediately submit it when done!

### 2. Problems

After implementing water, your main task of the week is to implement and submit these two problems:

- [Greedy](/problems/greedy)
- [Mario](/problems/mario-less)

Do not forget to submit your solutions on the problem pages. If `check50` is happy, you should submit them!

Before submitting, always keep in mind the course's policy on [collaboration and academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (plagiarism!).

### 3. Hacker problems

If you are quick to finish the previous two problems, and you have ample time left before the deadline, have a go at solving the "Hacker" problems. These are often substantially harder than the standard problems.

Solving and submitting the hacker problems in addition to the standard problems may earn you 1 extra point for this module. However, you must submit all problems before the original deadline to be eligible for this point.

- [Mario](/problems/mario-more), the hacker edition, a little bit harder than Mario
- [Credit](/problems/credit), a problem that is quite hard to solve

### 4. Tests

At the appointed times, you should take these tests:

- [Variables](/exercises/variables)
- [Unscratch](/exercises/unscratch)

### 5. Code review

Only after the deadline, you should perform code reviews with one or more other students, and re-submit some of your programs.

- [Module 1 code review](/reviews/c)
