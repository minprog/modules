# Retrospective: Fifteen

> Warning: the retrospective is linked to the formal **feedback** that you receive from the staff. Wait until feedback is published (it may take a while!) and then complete the retrospective below.

The feedback cycle during this course is all about the **quality** of the code that you write. The process comprises quite a number of steps that should help you understand what this quality is exactly, what you can do to influence quality and how you can assess quality in code that you or someone else wrote. Here's an overview of the process:

1. You are solving problems, writing programs, not always in good style, because you're totally focussed on problem solving.
2. When you're finished, it's likely that you want to improve your own code because you're already aware of some ideas to make code better.
3. You do code reviews with a partner, who can take a fresh view of your code, not knowing about how you wanted to write it and why.
4. You revise on your own code once more and submit the final versions for assessment by the course staff.
5. Your mentor assesses your submitted programs, finds how many points to award, and provides a few points of feedback on quality.
6. **And finally, where you are now:** you consider the feedback, compare it to your own ideas about your program and think about how you can use your considerations to improve your code in the future.

The form below is your task for this final step in the current review cycle. After completing the steps your points will be officially awarded.


## Aspects

For this module you reviewed your code using the following aspects:

  - [Formatting](/quality/aspects/formatting)
  - [Comments](/quality/aspects/comments)
  - [Naming](/quality/aspects/naming)
  - [Cleanup](/quality/aspects/cleanup)
  - [Nesting](/quality/aspects/nesting) (NEW!)
  - [Loops](/quality/aspects/loops) (NEW!)

Your mentor has provided you with feedback---you can find it on the [Submissions](/submissions) page.


## Question 1

What are differences (or similarities!) between the feedback from your mentor and the things that you focused on when revising your code before submitting the final versions?

## Question 2

What did you learn about writing "good code" during this module's feedback cycle? You may have learned by doing research, from the partner who reviewed your code, and from your mentor's feedback.

## Question 3

What would you like to improve for the programs in the next module, given what you have learned during current and earlier feedback cycles?

## Question 4

If anything, what isn't completely clear from the feedback that your mentor provided on your submitted programs? Your mentor will be able to read your answer.
