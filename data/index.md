# Module 5: Data

In this module you'll work with (large) data files, create your own simulations and practice working in a Jupyter Notebook environment. First, you'll dive into 100 years of weather data, uncoverin all kinds of statistics. Then, you'll simulate virus particles in a patient, and how these particles react to a new type of drug.  


## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

2. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.


## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Loops](/quality-aspects/loops)
- [Comments](/quality-aspects/comments)
- [Duplication](/quality-aspects/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality-aspects/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from previous weeks: [Magic numbers](/quality-aspects/magic-numbers), [Naming](/quality-aspects/naming) & [Whitespace](/quality-aspects/whitespace).


## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus) (like plagiarism).
