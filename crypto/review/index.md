# Code review: Crypto

> Warning: do not start code review until you **and** your partner are completely done and have submitted working versions of each program in the module. If you haven't finished your programs you should ask for help on that specifically and never look at someone else's code.
> Additionaly, your mentor should assign a partner for you: each week, it will be a **different** one. This is make sure that you encounter as many insights as possible about writing good code.

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. For each module, you will do a code review with one or more other students. In the code review, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

In order to keep the task within reasonable limits, for each module we will provide a number of **aspects** that you should consider during the review. These are also the aspects that your programs will be *primarily* graded on by the staff.

## What to do

0.  You will only review the mandatory assignments for this module. The extra assignments will not be considered.

1.  For this module, you will assess and improve your code along the following aspects. Take your time to fully read and grasp the descriptions there before you contact your partner.

    - [Formatting](/quality/aspects/formatting)
    - [Comments](/quality/aspects/comments)
    - [Naming](/quality/aspects/naming) (NEW!)
    - [Cleanup](/quality/aspects/cleanup) (NEW!)

2.  Before you start, don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much. And feel free to ignore the suggestions if you feel your code's layout is more consistent like it is.

3.  Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will **sit together** behind your computer or using screen sharing, and your partner will review your code on the criteria above. It is absolutely best if your partner can control your computer to browse through your code.

4.  Your partner will think aloud and ask questions about what they do not understand. Feel free to explain your code, but do focus on **listening**. Your partner can also provide advice, but you can decide for yourself what to do with that. Take notes.

5.  Now your partner will share their computer and you can browse through their code, ask questions and provide advice.

6.  Finally, take an hour or so to **improve your programs** by considering the feedback that you got in the review. Don't forget to re-read the explanations of the aspects once more!

## What to submit

Below, you will submit improved versions of your programs. In addition, you are going to document who helped you review your code and what changes you made in response to the review. That information is needed for grading!

Which student(s) contributed to reviewing your code?
<input name="form[reviewers]" type="text" required>

What changes did you make to your code in response to the reviews and feedback that you received?
<textarea name="form[changes]" rows="8" required></textarea>

What did you **not** change in response to the reviews, and why?
<textarea name="form[changes]" rows="3" required></textarea>
